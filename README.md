# ai-image-classification
image classification assigns labels to images based on their content, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the most effective deep learning models for this task. CNNs excel because they automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features — from simple edges to complex objects — through convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers .
